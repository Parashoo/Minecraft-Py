## DISCLAIMER
This is simply an attempt at recreating a game that already exists. This project is not supported in any way by Mojang AB or any of its developpers, and is not official in any way. Textures have been taken from the original Minecraft assets, and are not created by me. The code, however, is my property as I have written it myself. 
For the original version I am attempting to recreate, visit [minecraft.net]
